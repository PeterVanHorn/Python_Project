# Python_Project
Python game made following youtube tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECqUrT7IdqQ&list=WL&index=3&t=1957s
The code is entirely copied from the tutorial other than that I used a locally installed version of stablediffusion to create the textures.
This project was run using vsCode, pygame needed to be imported and then with the focus switched to the "Main" Python document just run the code and explore the small map.
